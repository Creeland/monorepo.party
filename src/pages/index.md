# Monorepo Party ðŸŽ‰

This is a collection of curated monorepo resources with a focus on [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/). It's put together by [Joel Hooks](https://twitter.com/jhooks) to support learners in a monorepo workshop.

## What are monorepos?

[monorepo.tools](https://monorepo.tools/) is an excellent intro into the world of monorepos from the folks at [nrwl](https://nrwl.io/). It gives a balanced look at the current landscape and provides a feature comparison across different tooling for monorepos. nrwl created and maintains the awesome Nx tool which is a great option for automating most monorepo tasks.

[monorepo.guide](https://monorepo.guide/) is a "monorepo style guide" from Thinkmill. This is tool agnostic and their how-to doesn't use any specific monorepo tooling and focuses on workspaces within the yarn package manager. The [Thinking in Monorepos](https://monorepo.guide/thinking-in-monorepos) article is a great place to start to get in the monorepo mindset.
